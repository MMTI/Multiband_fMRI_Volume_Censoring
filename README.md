# Multiband_fMRI_Volume_Censoring
This software allows a user to get optimal LPF-FD and GEV-DV volume censoring parameters based on a given dataset size, and, using either these parameters or other, user-specified parameters, obtain a vector of volumes censored using LPF-FD and GEV-DV methods using a given matrix of motion parameters (MPs) and a resting-state fMRI time series (either a voxel or greyordinate time series) and brain mask, respectively. These methods may be used separately or in tandem, and using images that are either pre-loaded into MATLAB or loaded using user-specified file names.
